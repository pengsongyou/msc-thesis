\subsection{Performance}
%----------------------------------------------
Compare between RGBD Fusion and RGB ratio, in terms of albedo and depth, in synthetic and real data

Compare between Robust and RGBD Fusion and RGB ratio, in terms of albedo and depth, in synthetic and real data

try to add noise on some of the images in the synthetic dataset and check the effectiveness of our method for robust normal recovery

compare the albedo estimation with state of the art intrinsic image decomposition
%----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Deal with specular objects}
%----------------------------------------------

%----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Runtime}
Compare 3 methods

Calculate the runtime when the number of image increases.
