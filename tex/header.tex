%ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Low-cost RGB-D cameras are playing an increasingly important role in many computer vision tasks, but their captured depth maps not only do not contain fine details of the objects but also have noisy or missing information.
This dissertation proposes two novel methods which can refine the rough depth images based on the theory of photometric stereo.

The first method called RGB ratio model can resolve the nonlinearity problem in most of previous methods and promise a closed-form solution.
And modern depth refinement approaches could not separate the shape from the complicated albedo so visible artefacts may appear on the refined depth.
We present another robust multi-light method which has the capability of enhancing the imperfect depth without any regularization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, we also combine our approach with image super-resolution such that the high-quality and high-resolution depth can be acquired. 
Quantitative and qualitative experiments have demonstrated the robustness and improvements of the suggested methods.

First of all, I would love to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers for offering me the master thesis opportunity in the Computer Vision Group. 
It is a great honour to be a member of your group. 
This thesis would not have been possible without the continuous support from my advisor Dr. Yvain Qu\'{e}au, who always believed me and gave my so many constructive suggestions. 
Thank you for your patience, trust and effort. 

I really appreciate the enormous help offered by one my best friends Tianming Qiu.
My stay in Munich would have been much harder without you.
My gratitude also goes to Nan, Hidenobu, Yuesong and all other master students sharing the office 02.09.053 for your warm accompany and motivation. 


I am much obliged to Prof. Peter Sturm, who supervised my summer internship in INRIA during the summer of 2016 and recommended me here for the thesis.
You, who has rigorous research attitude and extraordinary personality, have set an example to me in all respects.

I am particular thankful to all my VIBOT colleagues who made these wonderful two years one of my most special and satisfactory memories.
All the fun time, all the places we visited, and the projects, assignments and exams we have gone through together will flicker in my life.
%You will reconize yourselves: Kaisar, Jose, \`{E}ric, Oleksii, Duncan, Yogesh, Gourab, Raabid, Kibrom, Rami, Paola, Daudt. 

Most important of all, my dearest thanks goes to my beloved family.
You have been unconditionally supporting my decisions and giving me the best you have. I love you so much.

Songyou, well done, I am prooud of you.
